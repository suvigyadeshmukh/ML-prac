# Machine Learning Practice Journey 🚀

This repository is dedicated to my hands-on practice with Machine Learning. It contains my notes, code, and experiments as I work through the **Hands-On Machine Learning** curriculum.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **ML Prac/CH-2**: End-to-end Housing Project. Covers data cleaning, custom transformers, and model selection.
* **images/**: Visualizations and diagrams used in the notebooks.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
* **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values using `SimpleImputer`.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creating custom Scikit-Learn transformers (BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin).
* **Pipelines**: Streamlining the transformation process.
* **Outlier Detection**: Using `IsolationForest` to clean training data.

## 📝 Disclaimer
The code in this repository is for **educational purposes**. Much of the logic follows the examples provided in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. I am implementing these examples to strengthen my understanding of the ML lifecycle.
